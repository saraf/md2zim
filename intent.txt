# md2zim - Create a Zim note from Markdown content in Clipboard
#
# For working when invoked from git-bash in Windows 11
# Depends on: 
#   git-bash being present
#
# Pandoc being installed and present in the PATH - if not present, it should guide the user 
#    for installing it on Windows 11
#
# Reads in the markdown content from the clipboard:
#    can use /dev/clipboard on Windows to read in the clipboard contents into a variable

#
# For determining the filename of the zimwiki note:
#    Optionally takes in a string as a title of a note from the command line argument
#    if not present, uses the first level 1 heading from the markdown content - the first 
#    line that starts with a single hash '#' and generates the name of the output file
#    from it, appending a '.txt' extension, since zimwiki stores its notes as .txt files. 

# Optionally takes the path of the data directory of Zim on the command line. 
#     If not given or set in the environment - allow the user to configure it
#     Perhaps save it in the environment in git bash on the first run? 

# Uses the following command for converting markdown to zimwiki format: 
#    pandoc --from markdown --to zimwiki --output $outfile "$filename"
#    where outfile is a temporary file name

# Then uses sed - which is usually present in git-bash on Windows to insert the Content-type
#   header and the Creation date to the Zim note in the temporary file
#   sed -i "1 i\Content-Type:\ text/x-zim-wiki\nWiki-Format:\ zim\ 0.6\nCreation-Date:\ $(date --iso-8601=minutes)\n" $outfile
